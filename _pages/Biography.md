&nbsp; &nbsp;  Welcome to my homepage! I am currently a second-year PhD student at [Scalable Energy-Efficient Architecture Lab (SEAL)](https://seal.ece.ucsb.edu) at University of California, Santa Barbara. I am advised by [Prof. Yuan Xie](https://web.ece.ucsb.edu/~yuanxie/) and [Prof. Yufei Ding](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~yufeiding/). Before that I was at the [Center for Brain Inspired Computing Research (CBICR)](https://www.cbicr.tsinghua.edu.cn/english/) at Tsinghua university advised by [Prof. Guoqi Li](http://faculty.dpi.tsinghua.edu.cn/liguoqi.html).<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; I have a variety of **research interests** in the intersection of Deep Learning and Computer Architecture. My current work is about accelerating various backbone neural network models on GPGPU.
